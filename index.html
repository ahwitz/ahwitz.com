			<div class="section-subheader" title="Arguably. Some would beg to differ.">Music</div>
			<p>I graduated from Ithaca College in 2013 with a degree in saxophone performance, studying under professors Steven Mauk, Michael Titlebaum, Timothy Rosenberg, and Allison Adams. I've had the honor of working and performing alongside many notable musicians including Branford Marsalis, Clay Jenkins, Donald Sinta, Jerry Junkin, John Lynch, Kenneth Andrews, Steve Davis, and H. Robert Reynolds. You might also know me from old YouTube videos featuring (or chicken scratch on parts used by) the Ithaca College Jazz Ensemble, the Ithaca College Wind Ensemble, the MAHR Saxophone Quartet, and the Inter-Fraternity Council Big Band, of which I was the founder. I also played with the <a href="http://www.agelessjazz.org/wordpress/">Ageless Jazz Band</a>, the <a href="http://thenewmanbrothers.bandcamp.com/">Newman Brothers</a>, as well as <a href="http://runningtoplaces.org/">Running to Places</a> and Hangar Theater productions.</p> 

			<p>If you're interested in recordings of me, what I've chosen to publicize can probably be found on my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/jimmyalto" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXIPyvmfqx7mFLvWXL6TmuM5LTClGNRBc" target="_blank">this playlist</a>. For recital recordings or any other requests, please <a href="mailto:ahwitz+website@gmail.com">send me an email</a>.</p>

			<p>Since leaving Ithaca, I've slowly drifted away from my collection of woodwind instruments and have instead moved in the direction of my melodica and my installation of Finale. Since you're probably not looking for the former, here's an annotated list of my compositions:</p>

If you'd like to contact me about a contract or consulting position, please <a href="mailto:ahwitz+website@gmail.com">send me an email</a>.

                <p>I'm currently an application developer with <a href="http://rilm.org/" target="_blank">RILM</a> in NYC, serving primarily as the lead developer on MarkLogic-based editorial and search interfaces for a digitized version of the <a href="http://www.mgg-online.com/" target="_blank">MGG</a> encyclopedia. For this project, I'm working on indexing the data, implementing functionality and design on desktop and mobile clients, and building an API to communicate between the two. I also act as an AWS sysadmin, as well as contributing to various other internal projects.</p>

                <p>I was previously a member of the <a href="http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank">Distributed Digital Music Archives and Libraries</a> lab at McGill, helping <a href="https://github.com/DDMAL/" target="_blank">write software</a> to scan and analyze early music manuscripts. My primary responsibility was the <a href="https://github.com/DDMAL/meix.js" target="_blank">meix</a> XML editor, specifically tailored for use with the <a href="http://music-encoding.org/" target="_blank">Music Encoding Initiative</a>'s XML schemas.

                <p>Before the DDMAL, I was part of the development team for <a href="http://megsradio.fm/" target="_blank">MegsRadio</a>, a music recommendation and promotion service with a local focus. The project was (and is still) led by <a href="http://jimi.ithaca.edu/~dturnbull/academic/Home.html" target="_blank">Prof. Doug Turnbull</a> at Ithaca College. I developed a Google Maps-based directory of upcoming events, including an algorithm to determine each event's relevancy to each user's specific musical tastes, as well as revamping and optimizing the playlist creation algorithm. MegsRadio can be viewed at <a href="http://megsradio.fm" target="_blank">megsradio.fm</a>.</p>

                <p>Vida.js is a Javascript library that automatically paginates <a href="http://www.verovio.org/index.xhtml" target="_blank">Verovio</a>-generated scores. The library follows <a href="https://github.com/ddmal/diva.js" target="_blank">Diva.js</a> (to which I've also contributed) in both name and functionality, but deals with SVGs instead of facsimile images. The active repository for Vida.js is a set of ES6 classes that can be found <a href="https://github.com/ahwitz/Vida6" target="_blank">on my Github account</a>, and a legacy ES5 implementation still exists <a href="https://github.com/ddmal/vida.js" target="_blank">on the DDMAL's Github page</a>. If support is needed on the ES5 version, please don't hesitate to contact me, and I'll see what I can do for you.</p>

                <p>My <a href="https://github.com/ahwitz/es6-starter-kit" target="_blank">ES6 starter kit</a> is a single-Gulpfile Node application that hosts both an ES6/Backbone-based client and a Node server. A variation on this was first used by my colleagues at the DDMAL for a variety of their projects, and I've taken it, modified it a bit, and streamlined it for my use in a ton of my own projects. I hope to deprecate this soon once there's more widespread support for ES6 features, but I find it quite useful for now.</p>
